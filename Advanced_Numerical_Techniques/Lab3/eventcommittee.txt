How Can you contribute :-

For smooth functioning of the event main feature is the proper organization of events. Alloting proper time slot to each events for smooth flow of participants/ attendees from one event to another.
[ I mean not having continous guest lecturers or continous competitions...having alternate lectures and competition]
with proper breaks in between.
Will make sure that the attendees dosent loose intrest with time by having small interactive sessions in between.

Will allot proper number of members to look after smooth functioning of each event and the attendees the contact number of the members for direct contact in case of urgency.

For competitions judding would be made as transparent as possible.

To make sure speakers receive the required information about the event.
I would coordinate along with the Marketing team to share forms among the interested attendees for knowing their interest related to the lecture
Would convey with the speakers about that so they/we can conduct small trivas/question and answers in between to gain their interests and participation.

As a member of Event Team my main priority would be to make the events as interesting as possible and make sure of its smooth conduction.
